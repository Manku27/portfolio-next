# Problems

1. My system is set on Node 16.15.1 as per my office requirements but Next14 needs >= v18.17.0.
   The two possible options that come up are NVM - node version manager or something to do with Docker.
   I am chosing docker because I need more experience with it.
   PS. I am not using docker for deployment, I am using it for development, so it should be a little unconventional.
